# astrotools
Set of basic, useful routines and wrappers developed during my PhD.
A lot of the scripts here are quite locked down to the set up that I was using. 
Mainly in terms of a local Postgres database that I relied on quite heavily 
but perhaps some of the routines can be found useful by others.
